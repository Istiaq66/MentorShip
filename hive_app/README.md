##How to solve double click on delete method() and understant the concept

When you call setState, it triggers a rebuild of the widget tree, including the ListView.builder widget that displays the data from the studentBox. However, the rebuild might happen before the await studentBox.clear() operation completes. As a result, the first rebuild might still show the old data. Calling deleteData for the second time after the rebuild forces another rebuild, which will then reflect the cleared data.By using await to wait for the completion of the deleteData method, you ensure that the data is cleared before triggering the setState method. After the data is cleared, you can perform any additional state updates within the setState callback if necessary.

This way, the widget will be rebuilt after the studentBox is cleared, reflecting the changes in the ListView.builder widget and any other state-related updates you make inside the setState callback.


In the code you provided, the deleteData method is marked as async, indicating that it is an asynchronous task. The await keyword is used inside the method when calling studentBox.clear(), which suggests that it is awaiting the completion of the clear() method before proceeding.

Asynchronous tasks are typically used when dealing with potentially time-consuming operations, such as I/O operations or network requests, to avoid blocking the main thread and provide a responsive user interface.

In the case of deleteData, it seems to be an asynchronous task because it awaits the completion of the clear() operation on the studentBox before proceeding. This allows other code execution to continue while the clear operation is being performed.

By making the deleteData method asynchronous, you ensure that it won't block the main thread and will provide better responsiveness to the user interface.
