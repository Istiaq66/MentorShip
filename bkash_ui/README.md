## Getting Started

### Appbar

If your appbar has a lot of widgets then use custom appbar. Use the title property of the appbar to customize the 
Appbar widget to your liking.

### Gridview custom

When making a custom list like structure If you face any renderflex error you have to use expanded widget for all the elements in that particular row or column or else if won't work. So we should make a custom widget so that we can put the expanded widget on top of that custom widget. Thus renderflex is solved.
