# quiz_app

This is one the first project of our mentorship program. As a newbie in Flutter, I'm excited to share that I've built a quiz app using this amazing framework! It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I learned so much along the way. 


### About Project 
A quiz application using Flutter framework, integrating Hive as a local database for data storage. The app features engaging quiz questions and leverages a timer for added excitement. Upon completing each quiz successfully within the time limit, a celebratory confetti animation provides a visually rewarding experience.
