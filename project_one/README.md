# Dart Introduction for beginners 

## (Here I tried to code out basics of dart || All codes are commented in such a way that anyone can understand it)


1 Dart Installation:  Dart SDK & Environment variable setup

2 Project Structure: 
   Dart Tool â†’ Root of the project, version of dart
   bin â†’ Main dart folders
   Gitignore â†’ ignoring files when publishing 
   Analysis_options.yml â†’ Helps to analyze  errors
   Changelog.md â†’ Keep track of changes like version
   Pubsec.yml â†’ keep tracks of the external packages, version of the apk,name & version of the project, sdk version 
   Readme.md â†’ description of the project what the project does
   
## NB: codes are located in the bin folder ðŸ“‚
